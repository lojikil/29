# a simple test record 
# need to add:
# 
# - actual tests of helpers & such
# - polymorphic tests

record Foo {
    bar:int # should support simple types
    baz:int
    blah:float
    eh:string # should support complex types
    # NOTE (lojikil) I changed the test from
    # ref[Foo] to simply Foo, because not all
    # targets currently have a ref[any] output
    # in Golang that should be easy enough to
    # add, but for now, just make sure we can
    # pass tests in any target...
    next:Foo # should support recursive definition
}
