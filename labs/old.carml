#@(#) a base library for carML collections, meant to mimic what
#@(#) we see in systems like SRFI-1 and SRFI-13/14. It's called
#@(#) "old" because it is not module based, as the replacement
#@(#) should be. So why not just write that first? Because I
#@(#) have yet to define how modules are reified to the various
#@(#) languages I support as output from carML
