# Overview

This is the documents directory, which houses misc documents that I write whilst thinking about carML.

- (NOTES.md)[NOTES.md]: misc notes, mostly about lexing.
- (cml-README.md)[cml-README.md]: a previous attempt at something like carML, which I had called cML.
- (haskell_core.txt)[haskell_core.txt]: some quick notes on GHC's Core dialect.
- (todo.md)[todo.md]: my current TODO list for carML.
- (tooling.md)[tooling.md]: ideas surrounding tooling, like static analysis and the like.
