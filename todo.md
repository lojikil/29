A quick list of the current `TODO`s.

1. **DONE** Add complex types to `val`
1. Add complex types to records
1. Add complex types to `let` 
1. Parse `@` forms
1. Figure out a decent backing for Rust-style deques (possibly implemented from records + arrays)
1. Partial application syntax: `$()`, including `_` as filler
1. Hoare-logic (pre, post, invariants, &c.)
1. Runtime, which should be pretty minimal
1. Compile to C in the style of Enyalios
1. Compilation of variants
1. Compilation of polymorphic variants
1. OCaml/SML-style Modules, and their application to higher-kinded types
1. Friendlier REPL, with keyboard support, and a simple Logo-style `edit` command
